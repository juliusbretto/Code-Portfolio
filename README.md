# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Here you’ll find a selection of projects I’ve built over the years, both personal and academic.  

I work mainly in **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Matlab**, **SQL**, **HTML/CSS**, and have knowledge of **HTTP**, **IP**, and **machine learning / AI** (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, PyTorch). As you'll notice, I also have knowledge in **Figma**, **React** and **Unity** for more creative pursuits.

## 🎨 UX / UI Projects

I design primarily in **Figma** and have worked on UX/UI projects across **health tech**, **fintech**, **digital marketplaces**, **language learning**, and **VR**.

### 💰 BudgetBuddy – AI Financial Advisor
Co-created during my exchange at **DTU Copenhagen**. 
A chatbot-based financial planning app designed to help **young adults** manage their personal finances when moving away from home for the first time. We conducted multiple **user tests** and **iterative design sessions**.

### 🫀 ECG App for Elderly Users
Also co-created during my exchange at **DTU Copenhagen**.  
Again, we conducted multiple **user tests**, **A/B tests**, and **iterative design sessions** to develop an ECG monitoring app aimed at healthcare professionals and private users.

### 🎧 Audiogram – Hearing Test App
A prototype app designed to let users **test their hearing with audiograms** in a simple, accessible way. We were free to approach the hearing test problem in any way we wanted, which challenged us to think creatively. Instead of a standard clinical audiogram, we designed a game-like experience that makes hearing tests more engaging and accessible.
Focus was on creating a **clear, user-friendly interface** for a process that can often feel technical and medical.

### 🥽 VR Bartender Game
A **Unity + Oculus Quest 2** project exploring the differences between **haptic** and **visual feedback** in gameplay. Keep in mind this is *very* basic – first time I tried Unity *and* VR.
