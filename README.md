# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Here you’ll find a selection of projects I’ve built over the years, both personal and academic.  

I work mainly in **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Matlab**, **SQL**, **HTML/CSS**, and have knowledge of **HTTP**, **IP**, and **machine learning / AI** (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, PyTorch). As you'll notice, I also have knowledge in **Figma**, **React** and **Unity** for more creative pursuits.
