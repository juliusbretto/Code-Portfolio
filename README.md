This is a portfolio of some code I've written, either privately or for educational purpose, over the years. Some of the projects are very basic, but I tried to include as much different projects as possible to show my versatility. I am mostly proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, Matlab, SQL, HTML and CSS. Have knowledge of HTTPS and IPs as well, and have dabbled in C#.

Furthermore, I have done several projects in UX design in Figma. [Click here](https://www.figma.com/proto/h8rYvxVRC3jPVPWL5lxbEY/Final-Project-(Finance)?node-id=1060-3891&starting-point-node-id=1060%3A3880) for one of my projects where I, during my exchange term in Copenhagen, created an "AI Financial Advisor" to help youth with managing their finances upon moving away from home for the first time. When running the animation, be patient with answering the questions (this was part of our assignment) until you reach the home screen! :)
