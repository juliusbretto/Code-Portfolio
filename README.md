A portfolio of some code I've written, either privately or for educational purpose, over the years. Some of the projects are very basic, but I tried to include as much different
projects as possible to show my versatility. I am mostly proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, Matlab, SQL, HTML and CSS. Have knowledge of HTTPS and IP as well.
