This is a school project I did at KTH where I created an intelligent chessboard in which the board knows where the picked up pieces can go. Two-player game.

The game will alert the player when only one move is available for a picked piece, as well as promovate a pawn to a queen upon it venturing from one side of the chess board to the other. The game will also alert both players when a king is checked.
