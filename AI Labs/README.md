School project in AI. Three different labs discovering search algorithms, hidden markov models and reinforcement learning, respectively. 

For lab 1: search we used search algorithms to automatically make the player 1 win in a fishing derby against a just-as-competent competitor player 2 in a zero sum game.

For lab 2: hmm we designed a hidden markov model.

For lab 3: RL we used reinforcement learning algorithms and concepts to help an agent in finding the shortest and most effective way to the King Fish (high reward) without bumping into any jellyfish (negative reward).

Lots of files in these folders, it's an assignment in school so it can be hard to navigate.
