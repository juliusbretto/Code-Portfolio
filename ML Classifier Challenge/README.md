School project where we were supplied some labeled data to train a classifier on (TrainOnMe), then some unlabeled data to evaluate our classifier on (EvaluateOnMe) as well as generating some predictions based on this. Finally we were given the correct answers (Facit) and could use this file to calculate the efficiency of the classifier (Classifier.py). I think I got an accuracy of about 85% which was top 10 of the class of 200.
